What state messages do I need to parse?

To get a MARKET OFFERING OVERVIEW:
__________________________________
- TariffSpec (get info about tariff)
    - -rr --> from broker
    - addRate
- TariffStatus (Tariff is active
- TariffRevoke (when tariff is dead)
- Rate (creation of rate (with ID)
    - new
    - withValue
    - setTariffId
 
To get a Market PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
_____________________________________

- TariffSubscription
- TariffTransaction


to make parsing easier: always do: _jsm_NameOfMethodInJava
