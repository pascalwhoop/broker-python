"""
These functions serve the communication with the server.
Because the java client doesn't help us with ID management and prefixing the xml messages (some form of validation technique used in powertac), we need to do this on our own.
see `PowerTacBroker.java#handleMessage` for details

1. <broker-authentication username="brokername" password="secret" brokerTime="1521043835291"/>  is sent to server (handled by Java Adapter)
2. <broker-accept prefix="2" key="dlop5b" serverTime="1521046957413"/>                          is received by broker (cooked and passed)
3. we need to use the prefix for our ID generation and the key for prefixing xml messages. I know, the names...
4. Keep track of serverTime is also helpful so we can make sure we don't think too long with our agent.
