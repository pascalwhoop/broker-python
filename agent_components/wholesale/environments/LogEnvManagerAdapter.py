    """This class simulates a powertac trading environment but is based on logs of historical games.  It assumes that
    the broker actions have no impact on the clearing price which is a reasonable estimation for any market that has a
    large enough volume in relation to the broker trading volume. Of course this does not apply once the broker is large
    enough to itself have an influence on the clearing prices. In PowerTAC, the broker wil actually have a significant
    impact on the prices. Therefore this is an optimistic first stage learner for the broker. It will allow it to learn
    a certain base amount but will underperform once it acts in a live environment.

    The basic skills the broker learns in the wholesale trading are as follows:

    - based on a (changing) demand forecast, try to equalize the portfolio so that the broker doesn't incur any
      balancing costs by the DU
    - try to pay as little as possible for the energy needed at timeslot x. Buying earlier is cheaper but riskier

    These two goals are reasoned by the following assumptions: The wholesale trader has no influence on the amount of
    energy needed by its customers.  This is a partial truth because some brokers may be able to curtail their customers
    usage if market prices are too high and the cost of curtailing the customer is valued less than the cost of
    purchasing and delivering the energy. Because the current broker implementation does not make use of this ability,
    the assumption is correct.  Another assumption is the idea of the agents actions not influencing the clearing price.
    The server logs suggest clearing amounts of low two digit megawatt per timeslot.  If the broker simply tries to
    predict small amounts of energy, this assumption is appropriate. A broker that only represents a few dozen private
    households would therefore trade small kilowatt amounts per timeslot, barely influencing the market prices. An
    on-policy RL agent may therefore still learn successfully, despite the fact that the environment doesn't *actually*
    react to its actions.

    To allow the broker to learn with offline files, the following process is taken:

    - Creation of market price statistics with the `org.powertac.logtool.example.MktPriceStats` class
    - Creation of usage data with the `org.powertac.logtool.example.CustomerProductionConsumption` class
    - selecting a small set of customers as a permanent customer portfolio for the broker
    - passing observations to the agent
        - predictions from the demand predictor or alternatively, a true prediction (i.e. the real value) or a noisy
          prediction where the noise may be adapted
        - historical market clearing prices
        - rewards based on reward calculation function
